# Web Page Assignment

## Description 

In this project I created a responsive portfolio webpage following images that were provided to me (a wireframe). By combining html, css, and bootstrap I was able to put together the final product. 

As a result of the project, the webpage has responsive interaction across various screen sizes. Additionally, the features such as nav bar links allow the user to enter into different sections of the webpage.
